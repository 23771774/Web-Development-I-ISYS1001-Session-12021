        <h2>About Me?</h2>
        <p style="text-align: left;">I am a Linux Enthusiast. I love playing around with Operating Systems. Most of the
            time I am lurking around
            Linux Distributions
            seeing what they offer and what built-in tools are available, how upgrade/downgrade system works, how
            package management system works,
            what is containerized system, etc. I have about 30 different OS running on virtual machine who follows their
            own philosophy of handling system.
            I have also created my own first raspPI os based on debian but, it's very out dated and I don't have much
            time to invest on that project since it doesn't pay me. (If someone who is interested can download and use
            it from <span><a href="https://diggajupadhyay.com.np/downloads/">rasPI OS</a></span>)

        <h2>Uploading files to infotech using command line</h2>
        <p>I personally use script to do these kind of work but, to make things clear I will share a simple instruction
            on how to
            upload your website directory(folder) i.e Assignment_1/ to the remote directory where your public_html/
            may be hosted.
        </p>

            <img src="images/rsync.png" alt="my Linux Desktop" style="max-width: 250px;">
        </a>
        <p>Follow the Instructions if you can open a bash/zsh shell. Then, type in the commands but, be careful to change
            the variables and paths as it is not the same</p>
        <ol>
            <blockquote style="font-weight:900;">$ rsync -azvP index.html about.html contact.html readme.txt css images \
                yourusername@infotech.scu.edu.au:public_html/
            </blockquote>
            <p style="text-align: left;">Note: Replace the name of files you want to transfer and your username.</p>
            <p style="text-align: left;"><i>if everything is correct it should ask you for the password and enter your given password.</i></p>
            <p style="text-align: left;">And, that was it! Your files and folders have been uploaded to the website in a matter of minute without even dealing with
                ftp clients like Filezilla.
            </p>
