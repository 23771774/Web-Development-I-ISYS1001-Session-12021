    <h2>Background</h2>
    <p>I am Diggaj Upadhyay. I am from Nepal and I have recently moved to Australia
        to accomplish my further studies. I am an indoor person who prefer to read books,
        play Guitar / listen to music, play virtual games, etc. However, I enjoy
        going out and meeting friends, hiking, bicycling, swimming, etc.
        <br>
    <h2>What am I studying?</h2>
    <p>I am studying Bachelors of Software Development in Southern Cross University in
        Western Australia. As a person who is very curious in working with computers
        I am very excited to learn what my Campus has to offer.
    </p>
    <h2>What is my expectation?</h2>
    <p>So far we have begun with Web Development in our season 1 Year 1 and I am already
        learning so much from it. I hope to get a better understanding of the real world
        problem solving techniques and what we may situations we may encounter and
        where to look solutions for, etc.</p>
