            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>I am Diggaj Upadhyay. I am from Nepal and I have recently moved to Australia
                to accomplish my further studies. I am an indoor person who prefer to read books,
                play Guitar / listen to music, play virtual games, etc. However, I enjoy
                going out and meeting friends, hiking, bicycling, swimming, etc. <a href="about.html"

                    more..</a>
            <h2>What am I studying?</h2>
            <p>I am studying Bachelors of Software Development in Southern Cross University in
                Western Australia. As a person who is very curious in working with computers
                I am very excited to learn what my Campus has to offer.
            </p>
            <h2>What is my expectation?</h2>
            <p>So far we have begun with Web Development in our season 1 Year 1 and I am already
                learning so much from it. I hope to get a better understanding of the real world
                problem solving techniques and what we may situations we may encounter and
                where to look solutions for, etc.</p>
            <h2>GitHub</h2>
            <p>This Website is also hosted in github and there are so many commits done by my personal account and the
                student account so that
                may clarify the project was done from scratch and is rough around the edges.
