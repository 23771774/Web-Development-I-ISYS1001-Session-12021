Hi, Welcome to my Web Development I ISYS1001 Session 1 2021 Assessment. Copying my work is strictly 
prohibited. I like to keep a copy of my assignments in the Internet because I can access it anytime and from anywhere then start working on it without even having to worry about loosing my current changes. Thus, I like GitHub rather than some ordinary cloud service provider. If you don't know much about Git I recomment you to read it and get a better understanding of it. It is going to save you so much time and you'll be blown away by what features it has to offer.

Now that I don't have right training to teach you everything from scratch I'm going to assume you follow along because you have a basic understanding of GitHub.

1) Clone my Git Project either with https or GitHub Cli into your preferred local directory. I would recommend https cloning.
2) Change the directory to the root web directory
3) Open .html file to view it in your browser.
4) If any changes are made please leave a note why it should be modified. 

Thank you for your time.


Note: 
Soon the webpage will be uploaded to my website inside a directory called 'dupadhyay11'. Therefore, the url of the webpage will look like: https://diggajupadhyay.xyz/dupadhyay11
